# Twitch notification bot

## Description

The "Twitch notification bot" is a Telegram bot that sends notifications to Telegram users when selected streamers start broadcasting.

It can be used to receiving notifications if you don't use the app, or if you don't receive notifications from the app (sometimes this is happening), or to avoid receiving all notifications from the Twitch app.

This bot is a great tool for avid Twitch users who want to stay updated on their favorite streamers' activities without having the app. With the Twitch notification bot, you can customize your notifications to only receive alerts when certain streamers go live, making it easier to keep track of your favorite content creators. Additionally, if you're someone who doesn't use the Twitch app often or if you're experiencing issues with receiving notifications from their app, this bot can be a useful for you. By sending notifications directly to your Telegram DMs, you'll never miss out on an important stream again.
